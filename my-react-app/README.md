# React

1st day - created React app.
        - index.html => is the main file of the web page and in script tag we link main.jsx file using src="" class.
        - giving a div tag and adding an id to it can add the jsx(react) to it.
        - main.jsx => we are creating a ReactDOM (ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render)
        .creatRoot() => inside creating a "document" which access the index.HTML page by its ID root .
        .render => used to modify data between 2 jsx files.
        - import App from "./App.jsx" => <App/>(function Name) => imports from App.jsx by its function name
        - App.jsx => this is the file which we link all the extra jsx file which we create.
           In this we import jsx files and return data into our web page.
           <><Header/><Footer/></> ==> here, (Header and Footer are the jsx files created by user.)
                        <></> => are the fragments used to return multiple function names
                        <Header/> & <Footer/> => Function Names
    ***these will come when we create new react app***
