# React

1st day - created React app.
        - index.html => is the main file of the web page and in script tag we link main.jsx file using src="" class.
        - giving a div tag and adding an id to it can add the jsx(react) to it.
        - main.jsx => we are creating a ReactDOM (ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render)
        .creatRoot() => inside creating a "document" which access the index.HTML page by its ID root .
        .render => used to modify data between 2 jsx files.
        - import App from "./App.jsx" => <App/>(function Name) => imports from App.jsx by its function name
        - App.jsx =>
